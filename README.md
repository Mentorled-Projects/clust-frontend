# Clust - A Minimalist Event Planning tool
Clust is a minimalist event planning tool designed specifically for small groups and communities. It simplifies the entire process allowing users to create meetups, manage RSVPs, share event-related materials, and collect post-event feedback all in one unified platform.

## Project Goals

>>> Seamless Event Creation – Allow users to quickly form groups and create events.

>>> RSVP Management – Enable RSVP tracking with automated reminders.

>>> Content Sharing – Let users upload and share files like event agendas, slides, etc.

>>> Feedback Collection – Gather post-event feedback efficiently.

## Problem Statement

Small communities often rely on a patchwork of tools like email, messaging apps, and spreadsheets to plan and manage events. This fragmentation leads to confusion, missed communication, and poor attendance.

>>> Group & Event Creation: Users can create groups and schedule events within them.

>>> RSVP System: Attendees can RSVP to events, and organizers can track responses.

>>> File Uploads: Secure sharing of event materials.

>>> Feedback Form: Simple, customizable form to collect attendee feedback.
